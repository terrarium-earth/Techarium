# Techarium

Techarium is a Multiblock-focused industrial-futuristic-themed tech mod whose objective is to provide a complete set of
machines to enhance regular Minecraft gameplay and provide new mechanics and ways to enjoy factory building with a solid
aesthetic. Heavy emphasis is placed on renewable power options and keeping them competitive with non-renewables even in
endgame content, and this is accomplished first and foremost with solar powerâ€”the ultimate expression of this being the
Dyson Swarm.
